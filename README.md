### Operation:

The objective of the game is to place the blue, user controlled ball in such a way that it directs the green, game controlled ball into the end zone.

To launch the program, open a command prompt and cd to the "demo_batch" folder, and enter "Test.bat" to run. When prompted, press q and the program will load onto the board.

On the home screen, select either level to begin playing.

The operation is the same for both levels: use the PS2 mouse to place your ball anywhere inside the green rectangle near the top of the screen - the game won't allow you to place it anywhere else. Press the left mouse button to commit to a placement.

If the green (target) ball is moved to the red rectangle, you win.

If you were unsuccessful at shunting the target ball into the end zone, pressing the right mouse button will reset the level, however this will count as an attempt, and increase the score by 1 - the goal is to have the lowest score.

In level 1, the starting location for the target ball is fixed, making this level easier.

In level 2, the starting location for the target ball is randomized, so having good luck helps here, as well as knowing which places on the ball cause it to move most effectively.

If you want to take a break, or simply want a nice background, clicking the "Auto" button in level 2 will allow the game to play itself until the "Auto" button is clicked again.

To change levels or move to the home screen, click the "Exit" button at any time.

If you want to re-read the instructions, the "Instructions" button take you to a screen that has the game description. To leave the game, click the "Quit" button.

### Detalis:

| Item | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Hex Display | Features an LED chaser to signal program operation, as well as displaying the current score on the hex. Timer interrupts were utilized to update the chaser on regular intervals [1]. |
| PS2 Mouse | Wrote code to analyze the data stream incoming from the PS2 mouse, and only select 3-byte sequences that corresponded to valid mouse movements. Extracted mouse movements from the data, as well as button statuses. Used interrupts to update the mouse status in the game when a new packet was sent [1]. |
| Audio | Uses interrupts [1] to drive an audio interrupt service routine. The code was changed to use the audio interrupt generated when the input FIFO buffers are < 75% full to ensure no dropping of audio during game play. The audio was converted from a .wav file to an array of samples to be used in the program. |
| Video | Code was used to determine how to double-buffer the pixel buffer and how to use the character generator to display text. Video waits for the buffers to swap to drive timing and animation. Colour-depth conversion code was utilized as well. Code was also used to determine how to draw objects using BSP routines [1], and how to clear objects without using screen blanking. |
| Dissolve effect | Implemented an algorithm known as the "Knuth Shuffle" to create the desired effect on the pixels. |
| Game physics | Code was created for Verlet Integration [2] to stimulate and model the physics operating on the game object. This includes: gravity, collision against the ground and side walls, as well as collision between the game objects. The core equations stem from Newtonâ€™s equation of motion with constant acceleration. |
| Game logic | Code was created to detect the locations of the game objects to determine if they had stopped moving, if the target ball has entered the end zone, as well as incrementing the score. Additionally, an "Auto" mode was created that simulates a user clicking on the screen to let the game play itself. |
| Graphics | Includes drawing boxes, text, and circles. The splash screen was converted from a bitmap to a C array to be used in the program. |

### References:

- [1] Many of our routines utilized sample code and routines from the Board Support Package (BSP) to help setup interrupts, and access the board's memory in an optimized fashion. Code that contains "alt_up" utilizes these routines, which were created by Altera.
- [2] We used code from https://github.com/johnBuffer/VerletSFML as a framework to understand how Verlet Integration could be implemented.
- There are several files that needed to be included in the code submission because of the use of a custom Board Support Package that utilized the faster floating point hardware (float2), code that we wrote is under /software/hal-bsp and are the C source and header files, code in other folders are the work of Altera.
